# Philadelphia Crime Incidents and School Metrics Correlation Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores potential correlations between crime incidents in Philadelphia during the year 2024 and school performance metrics from the previous year, 2023. It aims to understand how crime rates might influence educational outcomes across different Police Service Areas (PSAs) in the city.

## Ethical Considerations
When analyzing data that involves crime statistics and educational performance, several ethical considerations must be taken into account:

- **Privacy and Anonymity**: While data sources are publicly available, care is taken to ensure that no personal information about individuals involved in crime reports or students in schools is used or disclosed. All analyses are performed at an aggregated level to maintain anonymity.

- **Bias and Fairness**: This analysis recognizes the potential for biases inherent in crime reporting and school performance evaluations. Efforts are made to present data and findings fairly, without perpetuating stereotypes or unfairly targeting specific communities.

- **Impact Awareness**: The findings from this analysis are intended to inform and support improvements in educational and community safety strategies. They should not be used to stigmatize communities or justify punitive measures that may adversely affect any demographic group.

- **Data Integrity and Transparency**: All sources of data are clearly documented, providing transparency about the origins and nature of the data used. Changes to data, such as cleaning or transformations, are also fully documented to ensure the analysis can be reproduced and verified by others.

## Data Sources
This analysis uses datasets from various public sources to provide a comprehensive view of the relationship between crime rates and school performance in Philadelphia:

### Crime Incidents (2024)
Detailed records of crime incidents within Philadelphia for the year 2024.
- [Crime Incidents Data](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/crime-incidents/)
- This file contains over 85,000 entries.

### School Performance Metrics (2023)
Performance metrics for Philadelphia schools for the school year 2022-2023.
- [School Metric Scores](https://www.philasd.org/performance/programsservices/open-data/school-performance/#school_progress_report_education_and_equity)

### Geospatial Data
- [Police Stations](https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/police-stations/)
